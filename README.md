# Coding for designers: haml, sass and stasis

First, this:

- [HAML](http://haml.info/)
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Stasis](http://stasis.me/)

## Necessary

- [Rubygems](http://rubygems.org/pages/download)

## Helpful

- [5 minutes of shell basics](http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/100)

- [5 minutes of git](http://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control)

- [github](http://github.com)-account and [github for mac](http://mac.github.com/) 


## What's inside

[The 1140 CSS Grid](http://cssgrid.net/) in its standard version as well as converted to haml and sass. I chose the 1140 because it is a great vehicle to learn what to avoid:

- works in % :(
- loads mobile styles extra instead of first :(
- `.last` class instead of `.first` class or css-selector :(
- has styles directly in the example html file :(

Just compare the original files in the `1140_CssGrid_2`-folder with the files in `haml-sass-1140` to learn the basic syntax.

[The stasis page](http://stasis.me/) will tell you how to render your haml and sass files into html and css.

## Fork

- Log into Github, [fork this repo and clone to your machine](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/). The cloning is easier with [Github for mac](http://mac.github.com/).

## Mod

- Convert [Eric Meyer's CSS reset](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) into a Sass partial and `@import` it into your 1140 sass file. [The Sass-Reference](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html) is your friend.

- Change the example page to make a site about cats. Your content is [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat).
